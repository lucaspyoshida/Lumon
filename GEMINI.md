# Project Overview

This project is a simple and interactive math game for kids called "Math Kids". It's a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning it can be installed on a mobile device and used offline.

The game features three main activities:
*   **Numbers:** Helps kids learn to recognize numbers.
*   **Sums:** Practice addition skills.
*   **Subtractions:** Practice subtraction skills.

For each activity, the user can choose between two modes:
*   **Sequential:** Questions are presented in a fixed order.
*   **Random:** Questions are presented in a random order.

The application has a clean and intuitive user interface, with a card-based design for presenting questions. Users can swipe right for a correct answer and left for an incorrect answer.

# Building and Running

This is a simple web project with no build process. To run the application, you can open the `index.htm` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Here are some of the development conventions used in the project:

*   **CSS:** The project uses a BEM-like naming convention for CSS classes.
*   **JavaScript:** The JavaScript code is organized into functions that handle specific tasks, such as navigation, question generation, and user input.
*   **Service Worker:** The project uses a service worker to cache the application's assets and provide offline functionality.
