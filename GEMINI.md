# Project Overview

This project is a simple and interactive game for kids called "Lumon". It's a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning it can be installed on a mobile device and used offline.

The game features four main activities:
*   **Numbers:** Helps kids learn to recognize numbers.
*   **Sums:** Practice addition skills.
*   **Subtractions:** Practice subtraction skills.
*   **Letters:** Helps kids learn to recognize letters.

For each activity, the user can choose between two modes:
*   **Sequential:** Questions are presented in a fixed order.
*   **Random:** Questions are presented in a random order.

The application has a clean and intuitive user interface, with a card-based design for presenting questions. Users can swipe right for a correct answer and left for an incorrect answer. At the end of each round, users can review their score and choose to practice the questions they got wrong.

# Building and Running

This is a simple web project with no build process. To run the application, you can open the `index.htm` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Here are some of the development conventions used in the project:

*   **CSS:** The project uses a BEM-like naming convention for CSS classes.
*   **JavaScript:** The JavaScript code is organized into functions that handle specific tasks, such as navigation, question generation, and user input.
*   **Service Worker:** The project uses a service worker to cache the application's assets and provide offline functionality.
*   **PWA:** The application is a Progressive Web App, with a manifest file and a service worker.
*   **User Experience:** The application provides a simple and intuitive user experience, with clear instructions and feedback.
*   **Customization:** The game allows for customization, such as selecting a custom range of numbers or letters, or creating a custom word for the "Letters" activity.
*   **Error Training:** Users can practice the questions they answered incorrectly, reinforcing their learning.
